        For any user query, generate a list of [year, type, region, customer, product] by following these strict rules:

        - For each field, ONLY use information that is explicitly and unambiguously stated in the user's query.
        - **Do NOT infer or guess any field value based on wording, general knowledge, phrasing, or common patterns.**
        - If a field is not explicitly stated or cannot be directly derived (e.g., from a cityâ†’country mapping for region), set its value to '' (empty string), except for year as specified below.
        - For 'year': Use the format yyyy only if a specific year is clearly provided. If no year is mentioned, set to 'All'.
        - For 'type': Only populate this field if an explicit document type is specifically mentioned in the query (win,loss,no_bid). General terms like "main documents", "files", "reports", "examples" must NOT be interpreted as a document type. If type is not clearly stated, set to '' (empty string).
        - For 'region': Use the correct two-letter country code ONLY if a specific country, city, or state is stated. If no location is provided or it cannot be mapped to a country, set to '' (empty string).
        - For 'customer': Only use the customer's name if it is explicitly provided. Otherwise, set to '' (empty string).
        - For 'product': Only use the product name if it is explicitly provided. Otherwise, set to '' (empty string).
        - For 'endYear': Use the format yyyy only if a specific year is clearly provided. If no year is mentioned, set to 'All'.

        NEVER fill a field with a default or inferred value except for 'year', which should be 'All' if missing.

        Example:
        Prompt: "Main documents in Australia"
        => Output: ['All', '', 'AU', '', '']
    """)
